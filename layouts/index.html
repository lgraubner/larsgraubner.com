        <p>I'm Lars Graubner, a full-stack developer from Germany and this is my personal website.</p>
        <p>Over the last 8 year I have worked in various areas of web development. I have seen and used a wide range of tools and programming languages. Today I work in a larger hosting company and try to use the optimal tools and programming languages to get the job done.</p>
        <p>I like to work with JavaScript, be it React in the frontend, or Node.js in the backend. I also enjoy working with PHP and the Symfony framework, creating complex applications, API's, websites and more.</p>
