    <p>
        I'm Lars Graubner, a full-stack developer from Germany and this is my
        personal website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the last 8 year I have worked in various areas of web development.
        I have seen and used a wide range of tools and programming languages.
        Today I work in a larger hosting company and try to use the optimal
        tools and programming languages to get the job done.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to work with JavaScript, be it React in the frontend, or Node.js
        in the backend. I also enjoy working with PHP and the Symfony framework,
        creating complex applications, API's, websites and more.
