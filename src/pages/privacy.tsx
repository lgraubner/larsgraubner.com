    <H3>SSL or TLS encryption</H3>
    <P>
      This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the

      {'"'} and the lock icon is displayed in your browser
      {"'"}s address bar.

    <H3>Cookies</H3>
    <P>
      Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and
      do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more
      user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that
      are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
    </P>
    <P>
      Most of the cookies we use are so-called {'"'}
      session cookies.
      {'"'} They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies
      remain in your device
      {"'"}s memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to
      recognize your browser when you next visit the site.
    </P>
    <P>
      You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so
      that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a
      cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically
      accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to
      automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies
      may limit the functionality of this website.
    </P>
    <P>
      Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to
      provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are
      stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website
      operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an
      optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies
      (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored,
      they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.
    </P>
    <H3>Server log files</H3>
    <P>
      The website provider automatically collects and stores information that
      your browser automatically transmits to us in {'"'}
      server log files

      contract.
    </P>
    <H2>Google Analytics</H2>
    <P>
      Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks
      and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and
      monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google
      services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and
      personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
    </P>
    <P>
      You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to
      Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser
      add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js,
      analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics
      about visits activity.

    <P>
      We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only
      with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You can revoke consent to the
      storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending
      the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the {'"'}
      unsubscribe
      {'"'} link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your
      request may still be legally processed.
    </P>
    <P>
      The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to
      distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said
      data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email
      addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.
