    <P>
      I'm Lars Graubner. I'm living in the north of Germany, not far away from
      the east sea which I enjoy a lot.
    </P>
    <P>
      Currently I work at{' '}
      <Link to="http://idearockers.com" nofollow>
        idearockers
      </Link>{' '}
      creating apps with React and React Native. From 2016 to 2017 I worked at a
      startup dealing with soccer bets and handling a lot of data. Prior to
      that, I worked at an advertising agency. This is where I learned the
      basics of web programming and got to know a lot of different types of
      clients and technologies.
    </P>
    <P>
      I'm involved in several open source projects. Check out my profile on{' '}
      <Link to="https://github.com/lgraubner">Github</Link> to learn more.
    </P>
    <P>
      Beside that I'm working as self-employed developer. I'm realizing small
      projects, ranging from simple websites to JavaScript apps and
      customizations. If you are looking for someone to implement your idea,{' '}

    </P>
    <P>
      When I'm doing none of those things I enjoy reading a good book and
      spending time with my family.
