Recently a lot of projects switched their default branch name from `master` to `main` and Github did so for every new repository created. A project I was working with had a (for me) weird syntax for pushing branches:

```git
git push origin master:main
```

I had not seen this colon syntax before and was wondering what it meant. After a quick research I learned that this pushes from the local `master` branch to a differently named remote branch (`main` in this case).

Ideally you rename your local branch with the following command to avoid the hassle:

```git
git branch -m main
```
